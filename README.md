# express-minimal-boilerplate
Very simple startup project to build Express APIs. It comes with settings I always use to make when starting a new API. I made it initially for myself, but I decided to publish it here in case it helps someone üôÇÔ∏è<br>
It is not complete and very simple yet, but the idea is to keep evolving it.
